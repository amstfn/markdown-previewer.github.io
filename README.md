# Markdown Editor and Previewer

This project consists of a Markdown editor and a previewer. The editor allows you to write and edit Markdown text, while the previewer displays the rendered HTML output in real-time.

## Features

- Live preview: As you type in the editor, the previewer updates to show the rendered HTML output.
- Markdown parsing: The previewer uses the `marked` library to parse Markdown syntax and convert it to HTML.
- Customizations: The previewer highlights specific words, such as "if", "function", and "return", with custom CSS classes to provide visual emphasis.
